## Output
Once you upload a well formatted copydeck.csv the tool will generate four files.
### ConversionFile.xml
This file only use is for debug purpose, this file  is the base for generating resource file it allow the conversion between the copydeck.csv and the resource files.

### Android resources
```
android-String.zip
    |-> values
        |-> string.xml
    |-> values-{langage-code}
        |-> string.xml
```

### IOS resources
```
iOS-Locale.zip
    |-> Base.lproj
        |-> Localizable.strings
    |-> {langage-code}.lproj
        |-> Localizable.strings
        
```

### i18Next resources

resources
    |-> Base.lproj
        |-> Localizable.strings
    |-> {langage-code}.lproj
        |-> Localizable.strings        
    |-> values
        |-> string.xml
    |-> values-{langage-code}
        |-> string.xml
```
## Output
The CSV file that will allow you to generate the resource file.
